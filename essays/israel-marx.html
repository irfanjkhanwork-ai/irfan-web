  <h1>An Enquiry Concerning Israel, Liberal Democracy and Karl Marx</h1>
  <div class="meta">— Irfan — 2024-01-02</div>

  <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
  <p>This essay examines Israel’s existence through Jewish history, Marx’s critique of liberal emancipation, and the persistent failure of liberal democracies to protect Jewish communities. It argues that Israel arose as a material necessity after centuries of exclusion, statelessness, and recurring antisemitism. At the same time, it contends that this necessity cannot justify the displacement or subjugation of Palestinians, whose own historical injustice demands equal recognition and statehood. The essay concludes that both peoples possess legitimate claims, making a two-state solution the only viable outcome.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Much of the discourse surrounding the existence of the State of Israel has been shaped either by superstition, as the late Christopher Hitchens argued on The Charlie Rose Show, or by political expediency. This essay does not seek to question Israel’s right to exist, but rather to examine the material foundations of its existence.</p>

  <h2>I. Genesis: The Jewish question & Historical context</h2>
  <p>The origins of the Jewish predicament in Europe reach far deeper than the Enlightenment. From antiquity, Jewish monotheism stood apart as a radical challenge to the pluralistic worldviews of Greco-Roman civilization. In societies that worshipped many gods and absorbed new deities through cultural exchange, the Jewish insistence on one invisible, universal God appeared not only unorthodox but subversive to imperial cohesion. Roman writers such as Tacitus condemned the Jews for their “obstinate faith” and “hatred of all others” (Histories 5.5), interpreting monotheism as a rejection of the civic cult that bound the empire together (Goodman 23). This early perception of Jewish separateness planted the seeds of what would later become religious and cultural othering.</p>

  <p>The rise of Christianity redefined this estrangement rather than erasing it. After the crucifixion of Jesus, the nascent Church, eager to distance itself from Judaism, constructed a theological narrative that placed collective blame on the Jews for the death of Christ. Augustine’s doctrine of witness framed Jews as a people condemned to wander, preserved only to testify to Christian truth (Ruether 61). For centuries, this doctrine underpinned the moral and political marginalization of Jews across Christendom. They were tolerated as outsiders but excluded from full participation in civic life, their existence serving as both a warning and a symbol of divine punishment.</p>

  <p>Medieval Europe institutionalized this exclusion. Jews were barred from land ownership, guilds, and many public offices; entire professions were closed to them. Economic survival therefore required adaptation to niches that were legally permissible yet socially stigmatized. Moneylending, trade, and finance, occupations essential yet morally suspect within Christian ethics, became among the few viable livelihoods available (Johnson 157). The Church’s prohibition of usury for Christians inadvertently positioned Jews as indispensable intermediaries in the emerging credit economies of medieval Europe (Hyman 44). Over time, this economic specialization fed enduring myths: Jews as controllers of money, usurers, and later, conspirators manipulating political power from behind the scenes.</p>

  <p>By the Enlightenment, this thousand-year history of religious othering and economic marginalization had transformed into a political problem: how could a people defined as the antithesis of Christian civilization be integrated into a secular, liberal state? The “Jewish Question” that emerged in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe was not merely about theology, but about the structural contradictions of modernity itself. As nations proclaimed universal rights, Jews remained marked as a distinct and suspect body within the citizenry (Birnbaum and Katznelson 98).</p>

  <p>In revolutionary France, emancipation was granted only on the condition that Jews cease to exist as a collective nation. As Count Stanislas de Clermont-Tonnerre famously declared during the National Assembly debates of 1789: “To the Jews as individuals, everything; to the Jews as a nation, nothing” (qtd. in Sutcliffe 42). The price of equality, then, was assimilation, a demand that Jews renounce their collective identity to be accepted as abstract citizens.</p>

  <p>Yet the promise of equality never fully materialized. Even as constitutions guaranteed civil rights, social and economic life remained structured by property, religion, and class. The Jewish individual in Europe became a mirror through which liberal democracy saw its own contradictions: formally free, yet socially estranged; legally equal, yet economically marginalized (Mendes 15).</p>

  <p>By the nineteenth century, this contradiction had deepened. The rise of capitalism, secular politics, and class stratification transformed the “Jewish Question” into a reflection of broader alienations. Bruno Bauer’s <em>Die Judenfrage</em> (1843) argued that Jews could not be emancipated without abandoning religion altogether, since “the Christian state can behave towards the Jews only as a Christian state, and the Jews can behave towards it only as Jews” (Bauer 19).</p>

  <p>Thus, before Israel’s founding, the Jewish experience itself already stood as a critique of Western liberalism’s promise of equality, a prelude to Marx’s own understanding of emancipation, not as a legal reform, but as a revolutionary reordering of material life.</p>

  <h2>II. Development: Marx’s critique — the answer to Bruno Bauer</h2>
  <p>It is often claimed that Karl Marx was an antisemite, a claim typically based on a superficial reading of the first half of his 1843 essay “On the Jewish Question.” Those who advance this claim often cite Marx’s harsh language about Judaism, lines such as, “What is the worldly religion of the Jew? Huckstering. What is his worldly God? Money… Money is the jealous god of Israel, in the face of which no other god may exist” (Early Writings 42). Read in isolation, this passage appears undeniably antisemitic. Yet this interpretation ignores both the historical context of Marx’s polemic and the essay’s dialectical conclusion.</p>

  <p>To understand Marx’s argument, one must begin with his immediate target: Bruno Bauer, a fellow Young Hegelian philosopher. Bauer’s book <em>Die Judenfrage</em> (1843) argued that Jews could not achieve political emancipation without first renouncing their religion and converting to Christianity, True freedom, Bauer claimed, required liberation from religious identity altogether. Marx’s essay was written as a direct response to Bauer’s position, not as a treatise on Judaism itself, as several scholars have noted, if one discusses Marx’s supposed antisemitism without understanding Bauer’s argument, one has missed the point entirely (Löwy 27).</p>

  <p>To situate Marx properly, one must recall that the nineteenth century was filled with “questions” of this kind, the Eastern Question concerning the Ottoman Empire’s decline, the German Question concerning national unification, and, of course, the Jewish Question: how Jews, recently emancipated from ghettos and granted citizenship after the Napoleonic reforms, could be integrated into modern nation-states. This “question” would later be perverted into Hitler’s “Final Solution to the Jewish Question.” But in Marx’s time, it referred to the tension between formal political rights and the persistence of social prejudice.</p>

  <p>Marx’s essay thus begins with provocative, even offensive rhetoric. He deliberately adopts the antisemitic idiom of his day , “huckstering,” “money-worship,” and “usury” not to endorse it, but to turn it inside out. His rhetorical strategy is dialectical: he begins within Bauer’s framework only to overturn it. Immediately after the infamous passage, Marx writes, “Very well then! Emancipation from huckstering and money, consequently from practical, real Judaism, would be the self-emancipation of our time” (Early Writings 43). He then continues: “Money has become a world power, and the practical Jewish spirit has become the practical spirit of the Christian nations. The Jews have emancipated themselves insofar as the Christians have become Jews” (44).</p>

  <p>The structure of the argument is now clear. Marx is not saying that Jews are uniquely avaricious; rather, he is arguing that the traits Bauer attributed to Jews, materialism, self-interest, and money-worship, are in fact universal features of bourgeois society. The “Jew,” in Marx’s essay, becomes a metaphor for the alienated man of capitalist modernity. His target is not Judaism, but capitalism itself. To isolate it and take it as an attack on Jewish people would be unjust to Marx.</p>

  <p>In layman's terms, Marx’s shocking rhetoric serves a polemical purpose: to expose the hypocrisy of Bauer’s reasoning. Bauer claimed that Jews could not be free without renouncing religion; Marx replies that no one can be free under a system that worships money. The problem is not Judaism but the world that makes “money the jealous god of all.” To use contemporary language, Marx’s argument might be paraphrased as: “You accuse Jews of huckstering? But in capitalist society, everyone hucksters. You condemn Jews for worshipping money? But money is now the universal god of Christians no less than of Jews.”</p>

  <p>Later sociological thinkers, particularly Max Weber, would echo this logic in <em>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</em> (1905), where Weber identifies the capitalist spirit not with Judaism but with the Protestant work ethic. In this sense, Marx’s analysis anticipated Weber’s argument: what Bauer mistook for “Jewish” characteristics were in fact capitalist ones.</p>

  <p>Marx’s conclusion is therefore universalist, not particularist. The so-called Jewish problem is, for him, a symptom of the human problem, the alienation of man in capitalist society. He insists that genuine emancipation requires abolishing the material conditions that perpetuate inequality, not merely reforming religion or granting legal rights. As he writes, “The emancipation of the Jews is the emancipation of mankind from Judaism,” where “Judaism” signifies the world of self-interest and commodity exchange, not a people or faith (Marx 45).</p>

  <p>Of course, modern readers rightly find Marx’s language disturbing. He uncritically reproduces the antisemitic stereotypes of his era, and his reliance on such imagery makes the essay difficult to read without discomfort. Yet, as historian Shlomo Avineri observes, “in spite of the clumsy phraseology and crude stereotyping, the essay was actually written as a defense of the Jews” (Avineri 53). Marx’s polemic, while marred by its nineteenth-century idiom, ultimately denies the theological and racial othering of Jews. He insists that their so-called faults are not inherent but socially produced and shared universally.</p>

  <p>More broadly, Marx’s treatment of religion reflects this same ambivalence. His famous line “Religion is the opium of the people” is often misread as dismissive. The full sentence, however, reveals a different tone: “Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people” (Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right 175). Here, religion is not condemned but understood as both solace and symptom, a painkiller for a suffering world.</p>

  <p>To put it simply, Marx’s critique of Judaism in “On the Jewish Question” functions not as a condemnation of Jews, but as a radical expansion of their situation into a universal framework. The “Jewish Question” becomes the “human question.” Marx’s message, stripped of its nineteenth-century rhetoric, is clear: emancipation is not about eradicating religion, or about reforming Jews or Christians, but about transforming the material conditions that enslave everyone.</p>

  <h2>III. Marx’s Critique: Political vs. Human Emancipation and the Limits of Liberal Democracy</h2>
  <p>Marx’s intervention in “On the Jewish Question” was not a study of Judaism, nor a commentary on Jewish theology, but a critique of the structural limits of liberal democracy itself. Bruno Bauer had argued that Jews could only be emancipated once they abandoned their religious identity, Marx responded by insisting that the problem did not lie with the Jews at all, but with the political order that claimed to emancipate them. Liberal states, he argued, granted political emancipation, formal rights, legal equality, and citizenship yet left untouched the deeper socio-economic structures that produced alienation, exclusion, and dependence (Marx 34–36).</p>

  <p>For Marx, political emancipation is abstract, it recognizes individuals as legal subjects while ignoring the material conditions that shape their lives. Human emancipation, by contrast, would require transforming the social order itself, eliminating the inequalities that make one group vulnerable to another. In this sense, Marx used the “Jewish Question” not as a theological problem, but as a symptom of a broader contradiction within liberal society itself. The persistence of Jewish alienation, even after formal emancipation, revealed the gap between liberal ideals and lived reality.</p>

  <p>This contradiction was not theoretical. Across the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the liberal states of Europe repeatedly demonstrated the fragility of Jewish citizenship. In France, the Dreyfus Affair (1894–1906) exposed the persistence of nationalist and clerical antisemitism within a republic that prided itself on universal equality. The scandal revealed how quickly the state could suspend legal protections when confronted with ethnic and religious prejudice (Birnbaum and Katznelson 81–84).</p>

  <p>In Eastern Europe, ostensibly “modernizing” constitutional states did little to prevent waves of pogroms that swept through the Russian Empire from 1881 onward. More than 200 pogroms occurred between 1903 and 1906, killing thousands and forcing millions of Jews to flee (Klier 112–15). Despite their legal status as imperial subjects, Jews remained structurally exposed to violence.</p>

  <p>Even Germany, often seen as the pinnacle of European Enlightenment, failed to translate political rights into material freedom. Jews were formally emancipated in the German Empire between 1869 and 1871, gaining full civil rights (Pulzer 52). Yet these rights proved brittle. During the Weimar Republic (1919–1933) a state founded explicitly on liberal democratic principles antisemitic parties won seats in parliament, and anti Jewish legislation was repeatedly proposed. By 1932, nearly one-third of German voters supported political parties that openly espoused antisemitism (Evans 28).</p>

  <p>Moreover, during the early years of National Socialism, Jews attempted to flee Germany but encountered a wall of restrictions from liberal democracies. The United States maintained restrictive immigration quotas under the 1924 Johnson Reed Act, which limited German immigration to fewer than 26,000 visas per year, quotas that were never fully issued due to bureaucratic obstruction and antisemitic officials (Breitman and Lichtman 44). Britain’s 1939 White Paper capped Jewish immigration to Palestine at 75,000 over five years, despite escalating persecution. At the 1938 Évian Conference, convened specifically to address the refugee crisis, thirty-two Western nations refused to significantly expand quotas. The Dominican Republic was the only country willing to accept more than a token number of Jews.</p>

  <p>Marx’s conceptual distinction between political and human emancipation thus gains tragic historical validation: Jews possessed rights on paper but lacked the material means of survival. Liberal democracy repeatedly affirmed universal principles while denying Jews entry, refuge, or safety when these principles mattered most.</p>

  <p>This is the historical and conceptual hinge on which the Jewish national project turns. Zionism did not emerge as a rejection of universal emancipation, nor as a nationalist fantasy, but as a response to its catastrophic failure. If Marx imagined that the “Jewish Question” would dissolve through universal human emancipation, European history revealed instead that particular, vulnerable minorities could not rely on abstract citizenship for protection.</p>

  <h2>IV. Why the State of Israel Is Necessary: Special Jewish Rights in the Face of Unmet Material Emancipation</h2>
  <p>If the promise of liberal democracy was to secure political rights and equality for all, the experience of Jewish communities in Europe and beyond demonstrates that these rights alone were insufficient. The story of the Jewish people in modernity reveals the persistence of scapegoating, exclusion, and vulnerability despite formal legal emancipation. This persistent structural insecurity provides the material foundation for arguing the necessity of the State of Israel, a polity with special rights for Jews, established in part to compensate for the world’s failure to deliver genuine human emancipation.</p>

  <p><strong>The Continuing Scapegoating of Jews</strong></p>
  <p>Various empirical studies show that Jewish individuals continue to experience social exclusion, harassment and violence, not merely as relics of history, but as active phenomena today. In the European Union, a survey by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights found that 96 % of Jewish respondents reported encountering antisemitism in the previous year; 80 % said antisemitism had increased in their country over the past five years.  Worldwide, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) reports that antisemitic incidents surged by 340 % globally in just two years.</p>

  <p>Of particular relevance is how the recent war in the Middle East has exacerbated this phenomenon. After the 7 October 2023 attack by the Hamas on Israel, antisemitic incidents rose sharply. In Germany, for example, the number of antisemitic acts in 2024 nearly doubled compared to 2023.  In the United States, the ADL recorded 9,354 antisemitic incidents in 2024, averaging more than twenty-five per day. These statistics confirm the grim reality: Jewish communities are not safeguarded solely by liberal citizenship.</p>

  <p><strong>Material Security and the Inadequacy of Formal Rights</strong></p>
  <p>The fact that antisemitism persists (or surges) even in societies with robust formal legal protections reveals that political emancipation, citizenship, equality under law is inadequate when the structural material conditions of security are ignored. The founding of Israel must therefore be understood in this context: a community for whom the world of equal rights failed repeatedly and catastrophically. In short, until conditions of material security, collective agency and refuge are met, the Jewish people remain vulnerable.</p>

  <p>Thus, a Jewish state, conceived as a refuge and a locus of self-determination, appears not as an optional nationalist project, but as a necessary historical response. The State of Israel did not simply emerge from spiritual aspirations or mythic promises; it emerged because the promises of liberal, universal emancipation were repeatedly broken. For a people whose history was one of statelessness and exposure, the state offers the only structural guarantee of survival or at least defence.</p>

  <p><strong>Compensatory safeguards for Jewish security and Their Justification</strong></p>
  <p>When we speak of “compensatory safeguards for Jewish security” in the context of Israel, we refer neither to an irrational privilege nor to a perpetual ethnocratic tyranny (though critics often treat it that way). Rather, we refer to a material compensatory logic: because the global system of liberal emancipation failed Jews, the Jewish people are entitled to a political order built around their material security, a guarantee of refuge, defence, self-determination, and communal agency. The historical record of Jewish vulnerability justifies this asymmetry in rights and responsibilities.</p>

  <p>While one might argue that all minorities deserve such safeguards, the Jewish case is uniquely strong, given two empirical facts: First, Jews in diaspora consistently face exclusion and violence, even in liberal societies (as the data above show). Second, Jews in diaspora lack a guaranteed territorial refuge under the global status quo, whereas many other communities may rely on nation-states of their own ethnicity or majority status. Hence, Israel serves not as a privilege but as a corrective instrument.</p>

  <p><strong>The War and the Persistence of Vulnerability</strong></p>
  <p>The war did not excuse the treatment of Jewish businesses, institutions, or individuals as if they were collective bearers of state responsibility. In fact, the opposite: the explosion of antisemitic acts following conflict shows how easily Jews become scapegoats, as individuals, as communities, as businesses, for global politics they cannot control. The argument is therefore clear: the war underscores the structural insecurity of Jews in the wider world and the necessity of a state whose raison d’être is protection and survival.</p>

  <h2>V. The Palestinian Question: Historical Injustice, Resistance, and the Limits of Special Rights</h2>
  <p>If the argument for Israel’s necessity rests on the persistent vulnerability of Jews and the structural failures of liberal democracy, this necessity does not nullify the parallel reality that the Palestinian people have endured profound historical injustice. The creation of Israel may have been, for Jews, a material necessity; for Palestinians, it represented a massive dislocation and the beginning of a political condition defined by dispossession, military occupation, and statelessness. Any serious materialist analysis must hold both of these truths simultaneously, without collapsing one into the other.</p>

  <p>From 1948 onward, Palestinians experienced what they refer to as the Nakba, the catastrophe marked by forced displacement, the destruction of villages, and the inability to return to their homes. Even after the 1967 war, when Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinians were denied the political, territorial, and economic foundations needed for sovereign self-determination. The presence of settlements, restrictions on movement, and asymmetrical legal systems produced conditions widely described by international bodies and human-rights organizations as forms of apartheid.</p>

  <p>To acknowledge the necessity of a Jewish state is not to deny this reality. Indeed, the moral and political legitimacy of Israel cannot rest upon a system that denies Palestinians their own capacity for material security, national identity, and political agency. As in the earlier analysis of Jewish history, we must distinguish between special rights for survival and structural domination. The former may be justified by Jewish vulnerability, the latter cannot be justified by anything.</p>

  <p><strong>October 7th: Not Madness in a Vacuum</strong></p>
  <p>The events of October 7th did not emerge from a void or from inexplicable irrationality. Rather, they arose from a political landscape defined by decades of occupation, blockade, and unequal power. To understand this is not to excuse the violence; it is to situate it within a dialectical frame.</p>

  <p>In a world where one population possesses a sovereign state, a powerful military, and international recognition, while another population remains stateless, territorially fragmented, and economically suffocated, acts of violent resistance inevitably emerge. Terrorism is not justified; but it is explicable. As Fanon argued, colonial violence begets counter violence not because it is moral, but because it is structurally inevitable.</p>

  <p>Thus, the Palestinian response is the antithesis to a system experienced as apartheid. Any political theory that treats Palestinian violence as pure barbarism while ignoring the material conditions that produced it is analytically incomplete and morally selective.</p>

  <p><strong>Rejecting the Equation of Jewish Safety with Palestinian Subjugation</strong></p>
  <p>Crucially, the argument for special Jewish rights must never be interpreted as the right to dominate, displace, or permanently disenfranchise Palestinians. The two logics are distinct.</p>

  <p>Special rights refer to guarantees of Jewish safety, refuge, and collective agency in light of global antisemitism.</p>

  <p>Apartheid, by contrast, refers to the structural privileging of one group at the expense of another’s fundamental political and human rights.</p>

  <p>One can defend the former while unequivocally rejecting the latter. To conflate them is to mistake necessity for impunity.</p>

  <p>Palestinians possess an equally legitimate claim to national existence. Their statelessness is not a natural condition but the result of political decisions that can and must be reversed. A society that emerged from the trauma of statelessness cannot morally justify perpetuating statelessness upon another people.</p>

  <p>The conclusion follows directly from the preceding analysis: if Jewish emancipation requires a sovereign state, and if Palestinian justice requires self-determination, then the only viable long-term settlement is a two-state solution.</p>

  <p>Israel must exist to guarantee Jewish safety, especially in a world where antisemitism persists.</p>

  <p>Palestine must exist to guarantee Palestinian dignity, agency, and freedom from domination.</p>

  <p>Any model that preserves one and negates the other is unsustainable. A single, bi-national state is historically improbable and politically unstable, given mutual fears, traumas, and national narratives. Perpetual occupation is immoral and strategically self-destructive. Ethnic cleansing would be a crime. Annexation without equal rights is apartheid.</p>

  <p>Thus, two states, however difficult to achieve, remain the only ethical and materialist conclusion.</p>
